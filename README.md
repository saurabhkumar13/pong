# Pong
_originally takkyu_

A multiplayer pong game, can be played as single player with bots, or on a local network with people (networking implemented with UDP socket programming).

The core idea behind this game is to create an NxN polygon for an N player game, in multiplayer as each player gets eliminated the polygon shrinks, eg for 4 players it goes from a square -> triangle -> finally a face off on a square board.
